    <!--About Me-->
    <div id="about" class="content-box">
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I’m Lauren Ciampa, a Missoula native and a nontraditional student in my third year of a media arts bachelor's degree, with certificates in entertainment management, graphic design, and web design.<br> After graduating from Hellgate High School, I lived in San Francisco, Boulder, and the San Juan Islands. In my mid twenties, I traveled the world as a biking and hiking trip leader, and between adventures, I pursued creative side projects—catering cupcakes, designing jewelry, and making art.</p>
        <p>I spent years bartending at the Myrtle Street Taphouse before managing the Northside location. When Covid hit, and the business shut down, I reassessed my path, realizing I wasn’t living up to my potential. I knew I wanted to help people tell their stories, collaborate with my community, and grow creatively and professionally. I first attended college at 21 for psychology and social work but left after two years, knowing it wasn’t my true calling. After a journey of many adventures, hard work, and self-discovery, I returned to school 15 years later—a challenging but deeply fulfilling commitment. In the last year, my life has drastically changed and devastating loss has carved yet another path for me. The transition has been a challenging to say the least, but I am doing my best to stay focused on my goals, working towards something that will continue to feed me.</p>
        <p>While still figuring out how to shape my skills into a career in this ever changing world, I stay open to new opportunities.<br>I bartend at the Kettlehouse Amphitheatre, work in TV/film production locally, and volunteer with Tell Us Something.<br>Outside of school, I enjoy spending time with my dog, Doc. When I find free time, playing with my friends and family, making art, being in nature, seeing live music, and traveling, bring me joy.</p>

    <!--Gaming Memory-->
    <div id="gaming-memory" class="content-box">
        <h1>Gaming Memory</h1>
        <p>In my adult life, I have not engaged with video games. I haven't had interest, and admittedly, I've had a more negative mindset about them, just having experienced people in my life who became consumed by them in unproductive ways. However, this prompt of considering a memory of playing a (video/computer) game has brought back some joyous memories and lessons I had completely forgotten about.</p> 
        <p>I remembered a game I played with my dad when I was about seven; I asked him if he remembered it, giving details of the characters we cared for (ours was named Katie?), hoping it would ignite something.<br>My 72 year old father responded with a picture of the (actual) computer disc Creatures circa 1996. He also told me he still had Myst, SimCity, SimTower, Asteroids, and Jewels of the Oracle and the computer we played them all those years ago. Suddenly, we were talking about where it was in the garage and how to get it running again, and I felt just as excited as I had been when I was seven.</p>
        <p>That is the beauty of games. There is a childlike wonder, an appeal to our curious and adventurous minds.<br>Other favorite games were Tetris, Clue, Candyland, Trouble, Twister, and my Tamagotchi; I never considered all the fun life lessons I learned without knowing it. I appreciate that the 90s lacked the technology to be what it is today. I grew up having my parents tell me to play outside, where I could keep myself entertained for hours with a made-up game with sticks and rocks. </p>
        <p>Through those games, though, when I think about it, I learned lessons about the environment, our world, people, animals, team building, logic, problem-solving, decision-making, critical and creative thinking, responsibility, real-world planning: economics, public service, transportation, community, zoning, population, technology, natural disasters, maps, land, crime, money, genetics, evolution, history, winning and losing. These memories have brought me a sense of wonder and a desire to explore more games now. </p>

    <!--Our World-->
    <div id="our-world" class="content-box">
        <h1>Our World</h1>
        <p>It's a challenging time to feel optimistic about our world. At my core, I know that there will always be good around, and there will always be helpers. Amongst the struggle, meaningful work and engaging outcomes will continue providing joy and lessons.</p>
        <p>But I am also sad and scared. My heart breaks for the division and hate that has become more apparent in recent years.<br>The dismissal of this beautiful and exhausted planet we share. The war, the wealth inequality, the disease, the anger, the grief, and the disregard for truth, humanity/human rights we've become accustomed to. It's overwhelming. On top of that, there is more isolation.<br>Many of our systems are set up to fail us individually and as a whole. As a returning college student in my mid-thirties, I have never felt so isolated and disconnected from my peers while trying to navigate living my adult life with all the responsibilities outside of my education and getting the most out of this (expensive) learning experience.</p>
        <p>Now more than ever, we need connection, education, community, conversation, collaboration, and balance(rest).<br>I absolutely think games can help us solve some of our problems. Games focused on education and development are essential.<br>Games that can creatively (and enjoyably) tackle topics such as the environment, climate change, science, sustainability, kindness, health and wellness, mental health, problem-solving, critical thinking, media literacy, economics, social, cultural, political, and global topics, teamwork and conflict resolution have the opportunity to inspire, engage, and share ideas.</p>
